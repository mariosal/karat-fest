# KSquares

We define a K-Square to be a natural number, n, that is a perfect square and its
square root can be obtained by splitting the decimal representation of n into 2
or more numbers then adding the numbers.

Examples:
- sqrt( 81 ) = 8 + 1
- sqrt(6724) = 6 + 72 + 4
- sqrt(8281) = 8 + 2 + 81 = 82 + 8 + 1
- sqrt(9801) = 98 + 0 + 1
