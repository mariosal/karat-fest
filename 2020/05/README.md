# KaratCoin

Karat did more interviews in one day than ever before on September 11, 2020.

Consider the sequence 1109202011092020*n mod 4503599627370517.

An element of this sequence is defined to be a KaratCoin if it is strictly
smaller than all previously found KaratCoins.

For example, the first term is 1109202011092020 which is the first KaratCoin.
The second term is 2218404022184040 which is greater than 1109202011092020 so is
not a KaratCoin. However, the fifth term is 1042410428089583 which is small
enough to be a new KaratCoin.

The sum of the first five KaratCoins is 4878094225435730.
